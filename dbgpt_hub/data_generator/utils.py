When generating natual language questions and their corresponding SQL queries, you should consider different SQL operators such as  WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, JOIN, INTERSECT, EXCEPT, UNION, NOT IN, OR, AND, EXISTS, LIKE as well as nested queries.
Moreover, please make sure that each table in the database appears in at least one query.

Easy: Queries that require basic filtering or aggregation on a single table.
Medium: Queries that encompass more complex filtering or aggregation and involve joining multiple tables.
Hard: Queries that entail advanced filtering or aggregation, multiple joins, and the use of subqueries.

Here is the basic information of database: {schema}

Based on the tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys and different difficulty levels, generate {easy_count} Easy, {medium_count} Medium, and {hard_count} Hard natural language questions with their correlated SQL queries.
Provide your answer in JSON form. Reply with only the answer in JSON form and include no other commentary:
